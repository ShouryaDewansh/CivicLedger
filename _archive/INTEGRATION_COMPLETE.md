## 🔐 Security & Privacy

### What's Secure ✅
- Vote content never sent to server (only SHA-256 hash)
- Merkle proofs provide tamper evidence
- Ed25519 signatures prove server commitments
- Client-side verification (no server needed)
- No personal information collected

### What's NOT Secure ❌
- No authentication (anyone can vote)
- No rate limiting (spam possible)
- No vote uniqueness checks
- Ephemeral server keys (restart invalidates)
- Not audited for production use

**Use Case**: Educational, hackathons, low-stakes community polls

---

## 🧪 Verification

### Backend Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/api/health
# {"status":"ok","uptime":3745}
```

### Frontend Check
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8080 | grep -o '<title>.*</title>'
# <title>CivicLedger - Privacy-Preserving Verifiable Voting</title>
```

### Full Test
```bash
cd /Users/shouryadewansh/Downloads/CivicLedger
npm test
# 46 passing tests
```

## 🎓 Key Concepts

### Merkle Trees
Binary tree where each leaf is a hash of data, and each parent is a hash of its children. Provides efficient proof that data is in the tree.

### Inclusion Proofs
Path from leaf to root, allowing verification without revealing other leaves.

### Digital Signatures
Ed25519 signatures prove the server created a specific commitment (root + metadata).

### Client-Side Hashing
Votes are hashed twice (SHA-256) before leaving the browser, ensuring privacy.
