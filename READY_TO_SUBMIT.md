   Backend: Node.js, Express, SQLite
   Crypto: merkletreejs, tweetnacl, crypto-js
   Deployment: Railway, Vercel, Docker
   ```

6. ✅ **Key Features**:
   - Privacy-preserving (client-side hashing)
   - Verifiable (Merkle proofs)
   - Tamper-evident (cryptographic commitments)
   - Modern UX (beautiful interface)

7. ✅ **Screenshots**: (Take these after deployment)
   - Home page
   - Poll creation
   - Voting interface
   - Receipt verification
   - Merkle proof details

8. ✅ **Demo Video**: (Optional but recommended)
