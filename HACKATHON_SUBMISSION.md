# 🏆 CivicLedger - Hackathon Submission

## 📋 Project Information

**Project Name**: CivicLedger  
**Tagline**: Privacy-Preserving Verifiable Voting System  
**Category**: Blockchain / Cryptography / Civic Tech  
**Team**: Shourya Dewansh  

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional voting systems suffer from three critical issues:
1. **Lack of Transparency** - Voters can't verify their vote was counted
2. **Privacy Concerns** - Centralized systems expose voter information
3. **Trust Issues** - No cryptographic proof of integrity

---

## 💡 Our Solution

CivicLedger uses **Merkle Trees** and **Ed25519 Signatures** to create a voting system that is:
- **Private**: Votes hashed client-side (server never sees content)
- **Verifiable**: Cryptographic receipts with inclusion proofs
- **Transparent**: Anyone can verify the Merkle root
- **Trustless**: Mathematical guarantees, not faith in institutions

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Client-Side Privacy
- SHA-256 double hashing before transmission
- Server only stores cryptographic commitments
- Optional secrets for enhanced privacy

### 2. Cryptographic Verification
- Merkle tree inclusion proofs (O(log n))
- Ed25519 digital signatures
- Client-side verification (offline capable)

### 3. Tamper Evidence
- Any vote manipulation changes Merkle root
- Immutable cryptographic trail
- Portable verification receipts

### 4. Modern UX
- Beautiful React + Tailwind interface
- Real-time feedback
- Mobile-responsive
- Intuitive verification UI

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

**Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui  
**Backend**: Node.js, Express, SQLite  
**Crypto**: merkletreejs, tweetnacl, crypto-js  
**Deployment**: Docker, Railway, Vercel

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

```
Client (Browser)
  ├── SHA-256 vote hashing
  ├── Merkle proof verification
  └── LocalStorage persistence
       ↓ HTTPS/JSON
Server (Express API)
  ├── Merkle tree builder
  ├── Inclusion proof generator
  └── Ed25519 signer
       ↓
Database (SQLite)
  ├── polls (metadata)
  ├── leaves (vote hashes)
  └── snapshots (signed roots)
```

---

## 🎬 Demo Flow

1. **Create Poll**: "Best Framework" with options [React, Vue, Angular]
2. **Cast Vote**: User selects "React" + optional secret
3. **Get Receipt**: Client receives Merkle proof + signature
4. **Verify Locally**: Client verifies proof without server
5. **Create Snapshot**: Admin creates signed state
6. **Re-verify**: All receipts still valid after snapshot

**Time**: 2 minutes end-to-end
