## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues

**Problem**: Build fails on Railway
```
Solution:
- Check package.json has "start": "node src/server.js"
- Verify Node version is >= 18
- Check Railway logs for specific error
```

**Problem**: API returns 500
```
Solution:
- Check Railway logs
- Verify environment variables are set
- Test health endpoint: /api/health
```

### Frontend Issues

**Problem**: Vercel build fails
```
Solution:
- Ensure Root Directory is "frontend"
- Check build logs for missing dependencies
- Verify package.json is in frontend/
```

**Problem**: API calls fail (CORS error)
```
Solution:
- Update backend CORS to allow Vercel domain
- In src/server.js, update cors() config
- Redeploy backend
```

**Problem**: Environment variable not working
```
Solution:
- Vercel env vars need VITE_ prefix
- Redeploy after adding env vars
- Check it's using production value in Network tab
```
